This project implements a class library to provide an object orientated api to the the HTML 5 canvas tag.
Modern browsers (any Gecko or WebKit browser) includes already an extended canvas support.

To enable partial canvas support in Internet Explorer have a look on the excanvas project at http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/
The usage in the Internet Explorer is limited to basic drawing functions, gradients with only two color stops. There is currently no support to draw text, apply a clipping path or do anything with ImageData.
